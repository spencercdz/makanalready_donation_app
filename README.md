# Makan Already - Codemmandos

Welcome to the **Makan Already** project repository! This is our submission for the **SUTD WTH: Reducing Inequalities** category. The application connects low-income families with food donors (buffet restaurant owners) to help redistribute food, tackling both food insecurity and food waste. 

## Key Features:
- **Advanced Account Registration and Login**: Secure user authentication for both food donors and recipients.
- **Listing Functionality**: Donors can list available food items, and recipients can view available listings.
- **Booking System with Confirmation Page**: Users can book food items, with a confirmation page to verify the booking.
- **Interactive Maps**: Integrated maps to locate donors and track available food items geographically.
- **Filter and Search Algorithms**: Users can filter and search listings by various criteria.
- **Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding**: Use of Nominatim API for geocoding and reverse geocoding to enable location-based searches and map integration.
- **Edit and Delete Listings**: Donors can manage their listings by editing or deleting them.

## Technologies Used:
- **Languages**: Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **APIs**: Nominatim (for maps, geocoding, and reverse geocoding)

## Inspiration:
Our team was inspired by our volunteering experience with **Food for the Heart** and **Food Bank** distribution drives. During our time volunteering, we noticed that the quality of food donated could be significantly improved for the low-income families that depend on these donations. This sparked the idea of creating a platform that connects food donors (such as buffet restaurant owners) with families in need.

## What the App Does:
The **Makan Already** app provides a platform where food donors can list surplus food, which is then made available for low-income families to book and pick up. The app helps address the issues of food insecurity and food waste by facilitating the redistribution of food that would otherwise go to waste.

## How We Built It:
- **Backend**: We used Python’s **Flask** library to build the backend of the application, ensuring smooth handling of user registrations, listings, and bookings.
- **Frontend**: The frontend is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience.
- **Map Integration**: We used **Nominatim API** to add geocoding and reverse geocoding functionality, which allows users to search for and locate available food listings on the map.

## Challenges We Encountered:
- **Map Feature Bugs**: We faced several challenges while implementing the map feature, especially with free map APIs that had request limits. This caused some hiccups in terms of the app's map functionality, but we managed to find solutions.
- **Financial Constraints**: Balancing our limited resources with the goal of addressing food insecurity and food waste was a challenge, especially as we sought to maximize the impact of our solution within these constraints.

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of:
- **First Hackathon Success**: Despite this being our first hackathon, we successfully built and deployed the application with the desired features and functionality.
- **Social Impact**: We are proud of the impact our app could potentially have in solving real-world problems, particularly around food security and food waste.

## What We Learned:
- **Creating Solutions for Social Issues**: This project taught us the complexities of creating applications that address social problems. It also gave us a deeper appreciation for social enterprises and the meaningful work they do.

## What's Next for **Makan Already**:
- **Further Development**: We plan to continue developing the app by adding more features and refining the user experience.
- **Expanding Beyond Food**: We are considering the possibility of expanding the scope of our app to redistribute other items, beyond food, to support low-income families further.
