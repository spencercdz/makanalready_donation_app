Our submission for SUTD WTH: Makan Already? website

Video demo: https://youtu.be/3jLETHXjJCk

Languages used: Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, JS
APIs: Nominatim

## Inspiration
A few of our teammates volunteered for Food for the Heart and Food Bank distribution donation drive and we felt that the quality of food donated can be better for the low-income families.

## What it does
The App connects low income families with food donors (Buffet Restaurant owners) for the purpose of food redistribution to solve food insecurity and food waste.

## How we built it
We used Python's Library Flask, HTML, CSS and Jayascript to create the app 

## Challenges we ran into
Faced a lot of bugs implementing the map feature using a free map API and exceeded the request limit for the API.

Balancing the financial constraints with achieving our goal to tackle food insecurity and food waste. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 
Despite being our first experience in a Hackathon, we were able to successfully creating the app with the desired features in mind.

## What we learned
The considerations when creating an application tackling a social issue. Gained respect for social enterprises and their contribution to society.

## What's next for Makan Already - Codemmandos 
Continue development of Makan Already and consider redistribution of other items other than food.
